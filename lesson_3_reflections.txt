When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The main reasons for having work on a remote repository would be to 
1) Collaborate with others
2) Share with others a completed project
3) Make it easier to work on multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It is likely there are changes that you do not want to save, or the timing of the save could leave you with incomplete work.
